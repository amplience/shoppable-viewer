# Shoppable viewer accelerator

This repository is intended as an accelerated starting point for creating responsive viewers to view [Amplience](http://www.amplience.com) media sets. These media sets can have imagery augmented with metadata using the Amplience POI application or automated processes. This will allow hotspots and polygons to be overlaid on the images which activate custom functionality on click or hover. It's quick to set up, easy to style and has lots of useful configuration options.
